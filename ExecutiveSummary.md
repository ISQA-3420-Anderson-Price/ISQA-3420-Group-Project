# Executive Summary

## Problem
Saving money and time while improving the quality of software development projects can be accomplished by utilizing [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software). For internal developers to leverage open-source software they must bring this software into the organization along with all associated licensing and vulnerability risks.

## Solution
Mitigating the risks associated with using open-source software, a system must be created to help manage the open-source software used by the organzation. This system will use state of the art systems to automate the process of identifying risks and steamline the evaluation process for new software.
